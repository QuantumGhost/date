# README

Package *date* provides functionality for working with dates.

This package introduces a light-weight *Date* type that is storage-efficient
and covenient for calendrical calculations and date parsing and formatting
(including years outside the [0,9999] interval).

## Credits

This package follows very closely the design of package *time*
(http://golang.org/pkg/time/) in the standard library, many of the *Date*
methods are implemented using the corresponding methods of the *time.Time*
type, and much of the documentation is copied directly from that package.
